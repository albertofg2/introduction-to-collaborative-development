Steps:

1. Compute the integral of the `sin` function in the `[0, pi / 2]` interval using two methods:
    1. Riemann sum (store the result in the `riemann_integral` variable).
    2. SciPy integration method (store the result in the `scipy_integral` variable).
2. Measure the time it takes for each one of the processes to complete and display the **difference** on screen. You will need to use some **performance counter** method from the `time` library.
