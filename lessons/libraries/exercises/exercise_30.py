import numpy as np

x=np.arange(0,2*PI,.1)






Generate a range between `0` and `2 * pi` (you might need to import `pi` from a library) with a step of `0.1`. Store it in a variable named `x`.
2. Generate, in one line, the images for all X values using the `sin` function. Do not use list comprehensions; you must pass the `x` array as an argument for the function. Store the result in a variable named `y`.
